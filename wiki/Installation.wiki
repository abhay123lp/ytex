=Prerequisites=
The following software must be installed:
  * Access to a SQL Server 2008 Database
  * MS SQL Server 2008 Tools [http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=08E52AC2-1D62-45F6-9A4A-4B76A8564A2B&displaylang=en download]
  This is required to execute SQL Scripts to set up the YTEX database schema.
  * JDK 1.6 [http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/widget/jdk6.jsp download]
  * Atleast 1 GB of free disk space

=Installation=
This assumes a Windows installation.  YTEX should work on unices (tests and instructions pending)
  # Create a directory where ytex and its dependencies will be installed, e.g. `c:\java\clinicalnlp`
  # Download the following archives to the installation directory:
    * YTEX Archive: `ytex-with-dependencies.zip`
    Download from this site
    * LVG 2010 Archive: `lvg2010lite.tgz`
    ([http://lexsrv3.nlm.nih.gov/LexSysGroup/Projects/lvg/2010/release/lvg2010lite.tgz download]).  Make sure you save this file as `lvg2010lite.tgz` (Internet Explorer may rename this).
    * UMLS Database Export: `umls.zip`.  
    You must have a valid [https://login.nlm.nih.gov/cas/login?service=http://umlsks.nlm.nih.gov/uPortal/Login UMLS License], available free of charge.  Send us (vngarla at gmail.com) your UMLS license confirmation, and we will send you the `umls.zip` file.
  # Extract `ytex-with-dependencies.zip` to the installation directory; this will create a `ytex` subdirectory, e.g. `c:\java\clinicalnlp\ytex`, referred to subsequently as `YTEX_HOME`
  The YTEX archive contains apache tomcat (`.\apache-tomcat-6.0.26`), apache ant (`.\apache-ant-1.8.0`), the SQL Server JDBC Driver 3.0 (`.\sqljdbc_3.0`), ytex (`.\ytex`), and the maveric arc and cTAKES pipelines (`.\ytex\maveric`).
  # Edit `YTEX_HOME\setenv.cmd`
  Fix the path references to match your environment.
  # Create `YTEX_HOME\config\desc\ytex.properties`
  In this file, you specify the SQL Server connection parameters.  Use `YTEX_HOME\config\desc\ytex.properties.example` as a template.
  # Execute setup.cmd
  Open a command prompt, navigate to `YTEX_HOME`, and execute `setup.cmd all`.  This will call the ant script `build-setup.xml`, which does the following:
    * Generates configuration files from templates
    The SQL Server connection parameters are added.
    * Unpacks and sets up UMLS Tables
    * Sets up YTEX Database Objects
    All YTEX Objects will be dropped and recreated (if this is the initial installation, ignore the errors about objects not existing when they are being dropped). SQL Scripts in the YTEX\data.mssql are executed using the MS SQL Server SQLCMD utility; UMLS tables are imported using the BCP utility.
    * Unpacks lvg data files
    * Sets up Semantic Search Web Application
    The semantic search web application will be deployed to a tomcat server under `YTEX_HOME\web\catalina`.

= YTEX Dependencies =
YTEX is distributed with the following software:
  * [http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?displaylang=en&FamilyID=a737000d-68d0-4531-b65d-da0f2a735707 MS SQL Server JDBC Driver v3.0]
  This is required for connectivity to the SQL Server Database.
  * [http://research.maveric.org/mig/arc/arc_v1.0_release_notes.html Maveric ARC Pipeline]
  YTEX uses the cTAKES version distributed with Maveric ARC.
  * [http://ant.apache.org/bindownload.cgi Apache Ant]
  The YTEX setup is automated via ant, a java-based scripting language.
  * [http://sourceforge.net/projects/ant-contrib/files/ Ant Contrib]
  * [http://tomcat.apache.org/download-60.cgi Apache Tomcat]
  The YTEX semantic search engine is distributed as a java web application, and can be deployed on Tomcat.
  
If you have already installed this software, you can install the YTEX using `ytex.zip` archive, which only contains YTEX and Maveric ARC.
